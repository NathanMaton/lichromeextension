# LinkedIn Job Posting Finder

This Chrome extension and Node.js script is designed to help you find job postings on LinkedIn. It works by:

1. **Extracting Connections**: It uses the LinkedIn API to extract information about your connections.
2. **Checking for Job Postings**: It checks if any of your connections have job postings on LinkedIn.

## To run the tests use the following command:
```
npm test
```
